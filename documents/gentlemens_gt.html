      <p>The <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/content/article.jsp?catId=cat440134a&categoryId=1000018&section=&pIndex=1&aId=3400019&start=2&multiPageMode=true">official Games Workshop Errata/FAQ documents</a> are required and will be employed at the Gentlemen&rsquo;s GT.

      <p><h3>Points Limit and Army Lists</h3> Army lists shall total no more than 1,850 points. Players must use the same army list for the entire tournament. Players must share their army list with their opponent before each game begins.</p>

      <p><h3>Models</h3> All models must be fully assembled.</p>

      <p>All models must be painted, based, and flocked. Any model that is not fully painted using at least three different colors and/or is not on a painted/flocked base (for models that require bases, of course; don&rsquo;t worry about mounting your Defilers!) <i>may not be used for any reason</i>.</p>

      <p>All models must be WYSIWYG. This rule is primarily focused on wargear and similar upgrades. The in-game abilities of every model should be apparent and represented.</p>

      <p>Conversions and &ldquo;counts as&rdquo; are allowed and highly encouraged&mdash;and might even earn you a special prize!&mdash;but the &ldquo;Reasonable Gentleman&rdquo; rule will be in effect. Conversions and &ldquo;counts as&rdquo; substitutes must be clearly discernible and must be done either for necessity (e.g., because an official model does not exist) or for artistic effect. Lazy &ldquo;counts as&rdquo; conversions will not be allowed. I.e., You cannot mount a shoebox on a post and call it a Stormraven. Nor can you substitute combi-meltas for combi-plasmas on your Space Marines just because you don&rsquo;t actually have combi-plasmas. On the other hand, building a detailed Stormraven out of cardboard or repurposing Tau plasma rifles or missile pods to represent Ork big shootas or rokkits for your characterful Ork Waaagh! are perfectly acceptable.</p>

      <p>If you are concerned about any of your conversions, please contact the <a href="mailto:iamdamocles@gmail.com?subject=Gentlemen's GT">event organizer</a> rather than wait until the day of the event.</p>

      <p>Finally, all players must supply 3 objective markers between 40mm and 60mm in diameter. Players are strongly encouraged to build and paint custom objective marker models themed to match their army, though this is not required.</p>

      <p><h3>Missions</h3> Each round will feature a unique combination of rules and objectives primarily derived from the standard missions in the Warhammer 40,000 rules. (I.e., They will feature some mixture of scoring objectives with Troops, accruing Kill Points, and/or accruing Victory Points, though variant mission objectives may also feature.) There will be Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary objectives in each mission. Primary objectives are worth 4 Mission Points, Secondary objectives are worth 3 Mission Points, and Tertiary objectives are worth 2 Mission Points. A player must earn more Mission Points than his or her opponent to win the game. Mission Points will be used to aid in pairing opponents and for tiebreakers.</p>

      <p><h3>Prizes</h3> Prizes based on attendance. Prizes awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places, appearance, best sportsman, not dead yet, and more.</p>

      <p><h3>Be a Gentleman</h3> This event respects all aspects of the Warhammer 40,000 hobby: gaming, painting, modeling, and sportsmanship. Players are expected to conduct themselves as &ldquo;proper gentlemen&rdquo; even while wearing their game faces and slaughtering their foes. After all, the slaughter is all in the name of having fun and appreciating the skill and labor our fellow gentlemen (and ladies) have poured into their armies.</p>

      <p>Players who cheat, collude, or who have otherwise violated the tournament rules may, at the discretion of the <a href="mailto:iamdamocles@gmail.com?subject=Gentlemen's GT">event organizer</a>, have their scores modified or, in extreme cases, be ejected from the event entirely and rendered ineligible for any prizes.</p>

      <p>Similarly, players who, in the judgement of the <a href="mailto:iamdamocles@gmail.com?subject=Gentlemen's GT">event organizer</a>, demonstrate egregiously unsportsmanlike conduct may also have their scores modified or be ejected from the event.</p>
